# Telegram - Discord Bridge

[![Pylint](https://github.com/hyp3rd/telegram-discord-bridge/actions/workflows/pylint.yml/badge.svg)][pylint_badge]

A `Python` bridge to forward messages from those pesky Telegram channels to a shiny Discord channel, because why not? It is highly customizable and allows you to configure various settings, such as forwarding messages with specific hashtags, mentioning roles or users in Discord, and more.

## Cunning Features

- Relocate messages from a multitude of Telegram channels
- Shove forwarded messages into a designated Discord channel
- It deals with Media and URL previews on your behalf (photos, videos, documents) from Telegram to Discord
- **The forwarding is configurable based on allowed or excluded hashtags, keeping irrelevant content away**
- **It handles connectivity and APIs outages for you, reconnecting automatically and forwarding the messages that were missed**
- It is customizable mention settings, including mentioning roles or users in Discord when forwarding messages
- It maintains the history, storing a map of the forwarded messages, allowing you to track correspondence between Telegram and Discord, **making possible replies**.
- **It supports OpenAI's API to generate suggestions and sentiment analyses based on the text you're forwarding.**
- It can run as a daemon and handle any shutdown gracefully, including `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals. It will also save the state of the bridge, so you can resume from where you left off
- You can enable logging to the file system, which will handle the rotation for you.

## Installation

First, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyp3rd/telegram-discord-bridge.git
cd telegram-discord-bridge
```

Next, follow the instructions here (don't worry, they won't bite):

1. Install **Python 3.10** or higher and set up a virtual environment;
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up a [**Telegram Application**](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id) and obtain the API creds.
4. Set up a Discord bridge with the necessary permissions to read and write the messages, and obtain the bridge token.

Now craft a new `config.yml` file in the `shared` directory, starting from the `config-example.yml` file.
**Keep in mind** that in the example below the angular brackets are indicating a placeholder `<>`, **remove them.**

  # built-in roles in discord, they need special attention when parsing thee name to mention

    - "<add the rest of your prompt, if any, here>.\n\n"
    - "<add the rest of your prompt, if any, here>.\n\n"

# The channels map to discord channels.
telegram_forwarders:
  - forwarder_name: "<forwarder_name>"
    tg_channel_id: <tg channel id>
    discord_channel_id: <discord channel id>
    strip_off_links: False # whether to strip off links from the message
    mention_everyone: True
    forward_everything: False # whether forwarding everything regardless the hashtag
    forward_hashtags:
      - name: "#example1"
        override_mention_everyone: True
      - name: "#example6"

  - forwarder_name: "<forwarder_name>"
    tg_channel_id: <tg channel id>
    discord_channel_id: <discord channel id>
    strip_off_links: False # whether to strip off links from the message
    mention_everyone: False
    forward_everything: False # whether forwarding everything regardless the hashtag
    mention_override:
      - tag: "#important"
        roles: ["everyone", "here", "@Admin"]
      - tag: "#trading"
        roles: ["Trading", "here"]
    forward_hashtags:
      - name: "#example3"
        override_mention_everyone: True
      - name: "#example4"
    excluded_hashtags:
      - name: "#sponsored"
      - name: "#sponsor"
```

Finally, start the bridge and watch the magic happen:

```bash
python forwarder.py --start  # it will start the bridge in the foreground
```

```bash
python forwarder.py --start --background  # it will start the bridge in background, requires the `Logger` console set to False
```

You can control the process with a stop command:

```bash
python forwarder.py --stop
```

## Usage

Once the script gets going, it will eavesdrop on new messages in the specified Telegram channels. Messages can be filtered based on hashtags, and you can configure the bridge to mention specific roles or users in Discord when forwarding messages. The bridge supports built-in Discord roles like "@everyone" and "@here" and custom role names.

In addition to text messages, the bridge can forward media files such as photos, videos, and documents from Telegram to Discord. The bridge also handles replies to messages and embeds them as Discord replies, maintaining a mapping of forwarded messages for easier correspondence tracking between the two platforms.

## Run it in Docker

You can run the bridge in a Docker container. The Docker image is available on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/hyp3rd/telegram-discord-bridge/pkgs/container/bridge).

```bash
docker run -p:8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/shared:/app/shared:ro -it ghcr.io/hyp3rd/bridge:v1.1.10
```

### Limitations

A local `JSON` file is the sole storage supported to maintain the correspondence between Telegram and Discord. It implies that you figure out how to rotate the file, or it will grow out of proportion. **I'm working on a solution to store the history in databases, Redis, and KV storage, but it still needs to be prepared.**
